# Lazy-Predict
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the Lazy Predict library to quickly train and evaluate multiple machine learning models with minimal code. Lazy Predict automates the process of model selection and comparison by running various algorithms and providing performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
